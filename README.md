## Featured Projects

### Customer Churn Prediction System  
**End-to-End Machine Learning | ANN | Predictive Analytics**

🔗 https://github.com/222000rohitkumar/customer_churn_predictor

**Problem**  
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and lifetime value. The goal was to proactively identify high-risk customers using historical behavioral and demographic data.

**Approach**
- Performed structured EDA to identify churn drivers  
- Built a reproducible preprocessing pipeline (encoding + scaling)  
- Trained and tuned an **Artificial Neural Network**  
- Persisted model and transformers for consistent inference  
- Designed API-ready architecture for deployment

**Outcome**
- Delivered a scalable churn prediction system  
- Enabled early churn detection for targeted retention strategies  
- Demonstrated full ML lifecycle ownership

## Interests & Opportunities

I am actively preparing for **product-focused data science and ML engineering roles**, particularly where:

- Models influence user or business decisions  
- Interpretability and metrics matter  
- Systems move beyond notebooks  

I am open to **internships, applied ML roles, and collaborative projects**.
